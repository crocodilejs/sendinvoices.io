Thanks for wanting to report an issue you've found in Glazed. Please fill in
the template below by replacing the html comments with an appropriate answer.
If unsure about something, just do as best as you're able.

glazed version: output of `VERSION` file in the root of your project
node version: output of `node -v`
platform: output of `uname -a` (we do not support Windows, sorry)

It will be much easier for us to fix the issue if a test case that reproduces
the problem is provided. Ideally this test case should not have any external
dependencies. We understand that it is not always possible to reduce your code
to a small test case, but we would appreciate to have as
much data as possible.  If your code snippet is long, please link us to a Gist.

Thank you!
